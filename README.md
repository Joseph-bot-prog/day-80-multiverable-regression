DAY 80 

Today's topic was analysis and compelling visualizations of House price data allowing performance with Multivariable Regression.
which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's .pairplot().

How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.

How to run a multivariable regression.

How to evaluate that regression based on the sign of its coefficients.

How to analyze and look for patterns in a model's residuals.

Project of the day

Multivariable Regression and Valuation Model; using the above-mentioned topics. You can check out my code. 

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher and for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
